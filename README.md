# About BBC News Labs Prototyping Kit

This is a fork of the [https://github.com/sahat/hackathon-starter.git](Hackathon Starter) project, a sample node.js application that comes ready made with a core set of functionality such as login support and account management features.

We'll be adding working examples of code showing how to consume the BBC APIs documented at [docs.bbcnewslabs.co.uk](http://docs.bcnewslabs.co.uk).
